# Exploratory_Data_Analysis-Hotel_Booking

I have done Data Analysis on Hotel_Booking dataset.

In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Famous libraries like [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/#:~:text=Plotly%20for%20Python.-,Overview,3%2Ddimensional%20use%2Dcases.), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), etc for analysis.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for coding!

I obtained the Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand).

**This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has from the data.**
